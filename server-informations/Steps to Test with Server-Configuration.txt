This process is use when I wanna use the configuration from my server-configuration

1- First step right to the file of this serve "bootstrap.properties" here change the enviorement variable to test (optional because Here im using a enviorement variable and this variable will be updated to test in each class test or method test )

2- Second step change this properties because im testing from my local
before : 
spring.cloud.config.uri=http://server-configuration:8888
after :
spring.cloud.config.uri=http://localhost:8888


3- Third step now execute the docker compose (like this :  docker-compose -f docker-compose-test-inf.yaml up), here I have all dependencies for testing the serve, only execute test when I wanna testing classessTest that depends from some  external services 
more exactly when the classTest have this definition 

DEPENDS 
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("test")
public class KeycloakServiceImplIntegrationTest {

NOT DEPENDS 
public class TokenAndRefreshTest {


THESE STEPS APPLY ONLY IN THE CASE THAT EXECUTE THE DOCKER-COMPOSE
4- Now check if the servers are running and Now you can testing any test from my application depends or not from a external service 
I have several way to test the methods
By mades of the IDE 
Or thorught the command 
some command 

to test all test: 
./mvnw.cmd test

to test a test from a class :
 ./mvnw.cmd -Dtest=ServerInformationApplicationTests#testSumSuccess test

 ETC
